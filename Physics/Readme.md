The Physics Sandbox has a Qt Project in which you can test and see the functionalities of the physics engine on a simple ground and simple object.

Outside of the Physics Sandbox are all the files of Physics: Collider, PhysicsEngine, Rigidbody and ground. 

Outside of the Physics Sandbox you now have a completed documentation of the Physics Classes with specification of methods you should or should not use outside of these classes.
